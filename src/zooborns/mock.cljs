For now, Elmer can see the Penguin flock through a Plexiglas partition.</p>\r\n<p>To maximize genetic diversity among zoo-dwelling birds, Black-footed Penguins are managed by the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums Species Survival Plan.&#0160; Elmer is the second chick for parents Millicent and Puddles.&#0160;&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Native to southern Africa, Black-footed Penguins are listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. &#0160;Populations have decreased dramatically in the last decades as Penguins&#39; prey has been reduced by overfishing, and oil spills have killed thousands of birds.</p>\r\n<p>See more photos of Elmer below.</p>\r\n"
